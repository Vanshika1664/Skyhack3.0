#✈️ Airline Ground Operations Dashboard
##📊 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes ground operations performance across multiple datasets to evaluate flight handling efficiency and operational bottlenecks.
The dashboard provides insights into flight turnaround performance, resource utilization, service requests, and overall operation difficulty, helping optimize workforce planning and reduce delays.

##🧠 Key Objectives

Evaluate ground time efficiency and identify delays vs. scheduled targets.

Assess flight difficulty scores based on service load, number of bags, ground time, and special requests.

Provide data-driven decision support for operations managers to optimize resource allocation.

Visualize trends and correlations across multiple flight parameters.

##🗂️ Data Sources

Flight Operations Data — includes flight schedule, ground time, and aircraft details.

Passenger & Service Data — includes service requests, checked bags, and passenger details.

Load & Crew Data — includes crew size, flight load, and other operational factors.

(All datasets were combined and cleaned using Power BI’s Power Query Editor.)

##⚙️ Feature Engineering

Derived and custom-calculated features include:

Difficulty Score = f(Service Requests, Load, Bags, Ground Time)

Ground Time Deviation = Actual Ground Time − Standard Turnaround Time

Baggage Load Ratio = Total Bags / Total Passengers

Service Intensity Index = Number of Special Requests per Passenger
